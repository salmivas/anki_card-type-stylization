# Anki notes stylization

Quick and simple "in one style" stylization of notes of my Anki cards collection

Just copy the code from the index.html into Anki card change window for the front and back templates accordingly. Styles for the Styling (which is shared beetween cards) are in the style.css file. Each folder relates to the certain type of the cards.
